## Integration

There are two possibilities for integrating adequate in a project. For one, it can be included as ES Module, which exports an object with the properties `element()`, `render()` and `useState()`. Alternatively, it can be included as a standalone file that defines the object `adequate` on `window`. In this case, the three previously mentioned functions are defined as properties `e`, `h` and `u`.
