<h3 id="elementrender-baseclass--htmlelement"><code>element(render, BaseClass = HTMLElement)</code></h3>
<p>The operation <code>element()</code> creates a Custom Element class. As arguments, it expects a render function and an optional base class (defaults to <code>HTMLElement</code>). The return value is a constructor that can be passed to <code>customElements.define()</code>. Note that the Custom Element types returned from this operation may not work as expected outside of adequate. Check the <a href="https://adequatejs.org/repl.html">REPL</a> for an example on how to build a general purpose Custom Element.</p>
<p>The passed in function <code>render()</code> is called every time an element instance needs to update. Upon invocation, it receives an object that contains all HTML attributes of the associated DOM element and the operation <code>dispatch()</code>. As return value the operation must provide a list of Template Literal tokens (typically created with <code>html()</code>). Every function expression that is used as HTML event attribute value is extracted and replaced with a reference. The helper operation <code>dispatch()</code> can be used inside a render function to dispatch DOM events. Effectively, it is a thin wrapper around the operation <code>dispatchEvent()</code> on the according element.</p>
<p>While adequate takes care re-rendering elements whenever needed, there is also manual option. Every instance of a Custom Element type exposes the function <code>update()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="htmlstrings-values"><code>html(strings, ...values)</code></h3>
<p>The operation <code>html()</code> is a tag function that transforms a Template Literal into a flattened and ordered list of tokens. Such a literal can contain an arbitrary combination of strings and expressions, including nested calls to the <code>html()</code> function itself. </p>
<h3 id="usestateinitialstate"><code>useState(initialState)</code></h3>
<p>The hook <code>useState()</code> works almost identical as the implementation in <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate">React</a>. As single argument, it expects an initial state value. The return value is a tuple with the current state as first item and an update function as the second one. Performing an update inside a render function of an element causes it to be re-rendered automatically. </p>
<p>One notable difference from the React implementation is that there is no support for the function updater form.</p>
